// The scheduler's queue (PLAN.md §4.5, "Scheduling"): future note-ons and note-offs, kept
// across blocks.
//
// Fixed capacity, allocated with its owner (prepareToPlay), never resized. An event is timed
// either in musical time (PPQ; the rhythmic effects) or in absolute samples (Strum in ms while
// stopped). A musical event's sample is worked out from the clock in the block it falls in, so
// a tempo change moves every musical event to its new sample by itself. On a loop wrap or a
// locate the owner moves the musical events (`forEach`), see ChordFx.h.
//
// Events due at the same sample come out in `order` (lower first: note-offs before note-ons,
// so a pitch that ends and starts on one sample is restruck), then in the order they were
// pushed. Plain C++, real-time safe; the queue is short, so a linear scan is fine.
