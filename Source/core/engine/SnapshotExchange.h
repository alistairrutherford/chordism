// Hands snapshots from one thread to another without locks or allocation (PLAN.md §5): the
// message thread publishes Chord Editor data to the audio thread, and the audio thread
// publishes what it played for the editor to show.
//
// Double-buffering with an atomic swap, in its safe form: three buffers. The writer fills its
// back buffer and swaps it with the shared middle one; the reader swaps its front buffer with
// the middle one when a new snapshot is waiting. The writer never touches the buffer the reader
// holds, however often it publishes, and neither side ever waits. One writer thread and one
// reader thread at a time.
//
// Plain C++, header-only.
